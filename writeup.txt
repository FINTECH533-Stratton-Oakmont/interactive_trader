Strategy:
The strategy we will be using in our trading algorithm is a pairs trading model using a distance approach. The "distance" we are referring to is the
difference in the z-transformed log prices between both stocks. This can also be referred to as the spread. Our strategy revolves around the assumption 
that the log-price of the stocks we are trading exhibit mean-reverting behavior, i.e. is stationary. This means that we assume that the log-prices of these 
stocks will eventually return to their average, and we can identify opportunities for arbitrage if one stock's log price is much higher than their average 
and another's is much lower than their average. Based on a certain threshold, i.e., a defined number of standard deviations, we can identify opportunities
to enter (i.e., place a trade) when the spread between the log-prices of two stocks is higher than this threshold. Once the spread has shrunk (i.e.,
difference in log-prices between the two stocks is small), we can exit the position and close the trade. We can also close the position
